# Temperature-in-California-Analysis
For applying the concepts I have learnt in environmental statistics course, I have used R for doing spatial analysis about the temperature of 3rd quarter in California. 
It includes:
   1. Descriptive analysis of temperature with respect to the Latitude and Longitude in Califonia.
   2. Applying different methods of interpolation to build heatmaps:
       1. Inverse Distance Weighting
       2. Trend Surface Model
       3. Kriging
